# OwlCarouselOTutorial

This Projects creates a Owl Carousel with Angular using ngx-owl-carousel-o package. The Owl Carousel is **responsive** , has spaces between them, **autoscroll** and includes previus & next button.

**Important**: Make sure to install the ngx-owl-carousel-o packages before seeing the compatibility in https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-owl-carousel-o. My angular version was 8.3.25 so i installed **ngx-owl-carousel-o version 2.1.1**.
